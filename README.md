# Laundry Tag Symbol Identifier

A simple app that utilizes AI to identify your laundry tag symbol and give you instructions on how to wash your clothes.

## Steps to completion

- [ ] Build placeholder frontend for jokes.
- [ ] Build a webscraper with Selenium to gather images of each type of symbol.
- [ ] Manually ensure all images are valid and label them.
- [ ] Train a Convolutional Neral Network to properly localize and classify laundry symbols.
- [ ] Dockerize and ship AI API using AWS.
- [ ] Redesign the interface.
- [ ] Do laundry. By the end of this I'll probably be able to identify all Laundry Symbols deeming this app useless to myself.
